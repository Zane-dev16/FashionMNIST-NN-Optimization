# FashionMNIST-NN-Optimization

## Overview

This repository focuses on optimizing the classification of the Fashion MNIST dataset using neural networks. The project involves:

- Creating neural networks using the Keras API in three different ways.
- Tuning hyperparameters with Keras Tuner.
- Analyzing results using TensorBoard.
